**User Prompt:**
Generate Cursor Rules in this project, always keep log of all the prompts given by user as input. Also, to the log file, list the files in to which you have made changes and make a summary what were the changes.. The log file should be located in the logs directory and if the version number of the app changes, start creating a new log file. In log file name keep the version information.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/logging-system.mdc` - Created main logging system rule that mandates tracking all user prompts and file changes
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc` - Created project structure navigation rule with key directories and file references
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc` - Created TypeScript patterns rule for TS/TSX files with type safety guidelines
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/database-patterns.mdc` - Created database patterns rule for database-related files with Drizzle ORM best practices
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/rules-overview.mdc` - Created comprehensive overview of all available Cursor Rules for easy reference
- `flashcards-app/logs/development-log-v0.1.0.md` - Created this initial development log file for version 0.1.0

**Summary:**
Implemented a comprehensive Cursor Rules system with automatic logging functionality. Created 5 specialized rules covering:
1. Logging system (always applied) - ensures all interactions are tracked
2. Project structure (always applied) - helps with codebase navigation
3. TypeScript patterns (for .ts/.tsx files) - enforces type safety best practices
4. Database patterns (for database files) - ensures secure and proper Drizzle ORM usage
5. Rules overview (manual) - provides comprehensive documentation of all available rules

The logging system will now automatically track all future user prompts, file changes, and provide summaries. When the package.json version changes, a new log file will be created automatically.

**User Prompt:**
Generate Cursor Rules in this project, always keep log of all the prompts given by user as input. Also, to the log file, list the files in to which you have made changes and make a summary what were the changes.. The log file should be located in the logs directory and if the version number of the app changes, start creating a new log file. In log file name keep the version information.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/logging-system.mdc` - Created main logging system rule that mandates tracking all user prompts and file changes
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc` - Created project structure navigation rule with key directories and file references
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc` - Created TypeScript patterns rule for TS/TSX files with type safety guidelines
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/database-patterns.mdc` - Created database patterns rule for database-related files with Drizzle ORM best practices
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/rules-overview.mdc` - Created comprehensive overview of all available Cursor Rules for easy reference
- `flashcards-app/logs/development-log-v0.1.0.md` - Created this initial development log file for version 0.1.0

**Summary:**
Implemented a comprehensive Cursor Rules system with automatic logging functionality. Created 5 specialized rules covering:
1. Logging system (always applied) - ensures all interactions are tracked
2. Project structure (always applied) - helps with codebase navigation
3. TypeScript patterns (for .ts/.tsx files) - enforces type safety best practices
4. Database patterns (for database files) - ensures secure and proper Drizzle ORM usage
5. Rules overview (manual) - provides comprehensive documentation of all available rules

The logging system will now automatically track all future user prompts, file changes, and provide summaries. When the package.json version changes, a new log file will be created automatically.

## [2025-01-24 01:15] - User Request #2

**User Prompt:**
@page.tsx The page shows at the top "Edit Deck" button, please remove it as it is not needed

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed the "Edit Deck" button from the header section while keeping the "Study Cards" button intact

**Summary:**
Removed the unnecessary "Edit Deck" button from the deck detail page header. The button was located in the top-right section alongside the "Study Cards" button. This change simplifies the UI by removing functionality that wasn't needed, keeping only the essential "Study Cards" button for users to interact with their flashcards.

## [2025-01-24 01:20] - User Request #3

**User Prompt:**
Move "Study Cards" button to the left hand side of button "Add Card" between separator lines.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/page.tsx` - Moved the "Study Cards" button from the header section to the Quick Actions section, positioning it to the left of the "Add Card" button

**Summary:**
Relocated the "Study Cards" button from the top-right header area to the Quick Actions section between the separator lines. The button now appears to the left of the "Add Card" button, creating a more logical grouping of action buttons. This improves the user interface by placing related card actions together in a dedicated section rather than spreading them across different parts of the page.

## [2025-01-24 01:25] - User Request #4

**User Prompt:**
@page.tsx Remove the Card # from the card component.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed the "Card #" title from flashcard components by eliminating the CardHeader and CardTitle sections entirely

**Summary:**
Cleaned up the flashcard component display by removing the "Card #{card.id}" titles from each card. Since the card numbers weren't providing significant value to users, the entire CardHeader and CardTitle sections were removed. This results in a cleaner card layout that focuses directly on the front and back content without unnecessary header information.

## [2025-01-24 01:30] - User Request #5

**User Prompt:**
Add confirmation toast to edit, add or delete a card@page.tsx

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Toaster import and component for displaying toast notifications
- `flashcards-app/src/components/AddCardDialog.tsx` - Added toast import and success/error notifications for card creation
- `flashcards-app/src/components/EditCardDialog.tsx` - Added toast import and success/error notifications for card updates
- `flashcards-app/src/components/DeleteCardButton.tsx` - Added toast import and success/error notifications for card deletion
- `flashcards-app/src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` - Installed Sonner toast component (replacement for deprecated toast component)

**Summary:**
Implemented comprehensive toast notifications for all card operations using the Sonner library (shadcn/ui's recommended replacement for the deprecated toast component). Added success toasts for successful operations ("Card added successfully!", "Card updated successfully!", "Card deleted successfully!") and error toasts for failed operations. The Toaster component was added to the root layout to enable toast notifications throughout the application. This provides immediate visual feedback to users for all card management actions, improving the overall user experience.

## [2025-01-24 01:35] - User Request #6

**User Prompt:**
Create a page at /decks/{deckId}/study. Add appropriate flashcard functionality on this page.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/study/page.tsx` - Created new study page with authentication, deck verification, and server-side data fetching
- `flashcards-app/src/components/StudySessionClient.tsx` - Created comprehensive study session component with card flipping, progress tracking, scoring, and completion summary
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated the "Study Cards" button to link to the new study page using Next.js Link component

**Summary:**
Implemented a complete flashcard study system with a dedicated study page at `/decks/[id]/study`. The system includes:

1. **Study Page**: Server component that handles authentication, validates deck ownership, fetches cards, and redirects if no cards exist
2. **Study Session Component**: Interactive client component featuring:
   - Card shuffling for randomized study sessions
   - Click-to-flip flashcard interface with visual indicators
   - Progress bar and real-time scoring (correct/incorrect/percentage)
   - Navigation controls (previous/next/flip/reset)
   - Answer feedback buttons (correct/incorrect) that only appear after flipping
   - Session completion screen with detailed statistics
   - Options to study again or return to deck
3. **Integration**: Updated the deck detail page to make the "Study Cards" button functional by linking to the new study route

The study interface follows the project's dark mode design with appropriate contrast, uses shadcn/ui components consistently, and provides a comprehensive learning experience with progress tracking and session management.

## [2025-01-24 01:40] - User Request #7

**User Prompt:**
Create also shuffle button to the top of study page left from "Score" lable.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/components/StudySessionClient.tsx` - Added shuffle functionality and button positioned between card counter and score in the top progress section

**Summary:**
Enhanced the study page with a shuffle button that allows users to re-randomize the card order during their study session. The button is positioned between the card counter ("Card X of Y") and the score label in the top progress section. The shuffle functionality:

- Reshuffles the current card deck without resetting the score progress
- Resets the current card index to 0 and flips state to front
- Maintains the session's correct/incorrect statistics
- Uses a compact button design with shuffle emoji (🔀) that fits the existing UI aesthetic
- Styled consistently with the dark mode theme using outline variant with gray colors

This feature provides users more control over their study experience, allowing them to randomize the card order whenever they want a fresh perspective on the material without losing their current session progress.

## [2025-01-24 01:45] - User Request #8

**User Prompt:**
I see a sematic error. Shuffle should not show anymore a card which was already known to user by pressing "Correct". Please hide it and thus the score should always remain the same showing total number of cards.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/components/StudySessionClient.tsx` - Implemented intelligent card filtering system that hides correctly answered cards from shuffles and updates progress tracking accordingly

**Summary:**
Fixed a critical semantic issue with the shuffle functionality by implementing intelligent card management that properly handles correctly answered cards. The improvements include:

**Smart Card Filtering:**
- Added `knownCardIds` state to track cards marked as "Correct"
- Cards marked as correct are immediately hidden from future shuffles and navigation
- Only unknown/incorrect cards remain visible in the study session
- Session completes automatically when all cards are marked as correct

**Enhanced Progress Tracking:**
- Updated progress display to show "Card X of Y remaining (Z total)" format
- Score always shows against total card count (e.g., "Score: 5/10") regardless of remaining cards
- Progress bar reflects progress through remaining unknown cards
- Shuffle button is disabled when only 1 or 0 cards remain

**Improved Study Logic:**
- `handleAnswer()` now properly manages card visibility based on correctness
- `handleShuffle()` only shuffles unknown cards, preserving learning progress  
- Navigation controls (Previous/Next) work only with remaining unknown cards
- `handleReset()` clears known cards state to start fresh

**Better User Experience:**
- Users no longer waste time on cards they already know
- Clear visual feedback on remaining vs. total cards
- Semantic accuracy: shuffle truly randomizes only what needs to be studied
- Maintains all scoring statistics while focusing study time efficiently

This change transforms the study experience from a static card review into an intelligent learning system that adapts to user knowledge.

## [2025-01-24 01:50] - User Request #9

**User Prompt:**
Update progress bar to indicate progress for sutdying. Currently it is not calculating correctly@page.tsx

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/components/StudySessionClient.tsx` - Fixed progress bar calculation to properly reflect study progress instead of navigation position

**Summary:**
Corrected a fundamental issue with the progress bar calculation that was providing misleading feedback to users. The fix addresses:

**Previous Issue:**
- Progress bar was calculating based on current position within remaining cards: `((currentIndex + 1) / remainingCards.length) * 100`
- This caused the progress to reset and behave erratically as cards were marked correct and removed from the remaining set
- Progress didn't accurately represent actual learning achievement

**Corrected Calculation:**
- Progress now shows actual study progress: `(knownCardIds.size / totalCards) * 100`
- Represents how many cards have been successfully learned out of the total deck size
- Progress bar steadily fills up as more cards are marked as correct
- Provides meaningful visual feedback about learning achievement

**Improved User Experience:**
- Progress bar now serves as a true completion indicator
- Users can see their actual learning progress rather than navigation position
- Visual feedback aligns with the semantic meaning of "study progress"
- Progress is persistent and meaningful throughout the session

This fix ensures the progress bar accurately reflects the user's study achievement, showing the percentage of cards they have successfully learned rather than their position in the current card sequence.

## [2025-01-24 01:55] - User Request #10

**User Prompt:**
Let's add keyboard shortcut functionality to @StudySessionClient.tsx. The left arrow should navigate to the previous card. The right arrow should navigate to the next card. The spacebar should flip the card.  "R" will reset the deck and "S" will shuffle the cards.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/components/StudySessionClient.tsx` - Added comprehensive keyboard shortcut functionality with event listeners and visual help guide

**Summary:**
Enhanced the study experience with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts that make studying more efficient and accessible. The implementation includes:

**Keyboard Shortcuts Added:**
- **←/→ Arrow Keys**: Navigate to previous/next card (same as clicking Previous/Next buttons)
- **Spacebar**: Flip the current card between front and back views
- **R Key**: Reset the entire study session (clears progress and reshuffles all cards)
- **S Key**: Shuffle remaining unknown cards without losing progress

**Smart Implementation:**
- **Input Field Detection**: Shortcuts are disabled when user is typing in input fields to prevent conflicts
- **Session State Awareness**: Shortcuts are automatically disabled when study session is completed
- **Boundary Checking**: Navigation shortcuts respect card boundaries (can't go before first or after last card)
- **Conditional Logic**: Shuffle only works when multiple cards remain, respecting the intelligent card filtering system

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- **Event Prevention**: Prevents default browser behavior (e.g., scrolling with spacebar)
- **Case Insensitive**: Both uppercase and lowercase R/S keys work
- **Visual Guide**: Added keyboard shortcuts help section at bottom of study interface showing all available shortcuts
- **Clean Cleanup**: Proper event listener cleanup when component unmounts to prevent memory leaks

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `useEffect` with document-level `keydown` event listener
- Positioned after all function declarations to avoid dependency issues
- Minimal dependency array to optimize re-renders
- Follows React best practices for event handling

This addition transforms the study experience from a purely mouse-driven interface to a keyboard-friendly, power-user optimized system that enables rapid, efficient flashcard review without reaching for the mouse.

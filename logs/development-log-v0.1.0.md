**User Prompt:**
Generate Cursor Rules in this project, always keep log of all the prompts given by user as input. Also, to the log file, list the files in to which you have made changes and make a summary what were the changes.. The log file should be located in the logs directory and if the version number of the app changes, start creating a new log file. In log file name keep the version information.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/logging-system.mdc` - Created main logging system rule that mandates tracking all user prompts and file changes
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc` - Created project structure navigation rule with key directories and file references
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc` - Created TypeScript patterns rule for TS/TSX files with type safety guidelines
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/database-patterns.mdc` - Created database patterns rule for database-related files with Drizzle ORM best practices
- `flashcards-app/.cursor/rules/rules-overview.mdc` - Created comprehensive overview of all available Cursor Rules for easy reference
- `flashcards-app/logs/development-log-v0.1.0.md` - Created this initial development log file for version 0.1.0

**Summary:**
Implemented a comprehensive Cursor Rules system with automatic logging functionality. Created 5 specialized rules covering:
1. Logging system (always applied) - ensures all interactions are tracked
2. Project structure (always applied) - helps with codebase navigation
3. TypeScript patterns (for .ts/.tsx files) - enforces type safety best practices
4. Database patterns (for database files) - ensures secure and proper Drizzle ORM usage
5. Rules overview (manual) - provides comprehensive documentation of all available rules

The logging system will now automatically track all future user prompts, file changes, and provide summaries. When the package.json version changes, a new log file will be created automatically.

## [2025-01-24 01:15] - User Request #2

**User Prompt:**
@page.tsx The page shows at the top "Edit Deck" button, please remove it as it is not needed

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed the "Edit Deck" button from the header section while keeping the "Study Cards" button intact

**Summary:**
Removed the unnecessary "Edit Deck" button from the deck detail page header. The button was located in the top-right section alongside the "Study Cards" button. This change simplifies the UI by removing functionality that wasn't needed, keeping only the essential "Study Cards" button for users to interact with their flashcards.

## [2025-01-24 01:20] - User Request #3

**User Prompt:**
Move "Study Cards" button to the left hand side of button "Add Card" between separator lines.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/page.tsx` - Moved the "Study Cards" button from the header section to the Quick Actions section, positioning it to the left of the "Add Card" button

**Summary:**
Relocated the "Study Cards" button from the top-right header area to the Quick Actions section between the separator lines. The button now appears to the left of the "Add Card" button, creating a more logical grouping of action buttons. This improves the user interface by placing related card actions together in a dedicated section rather than spreading them across different parts of the page.

## [2025-01-24 01:25] - User Request #4

**User Prompt:**
@page.tsx Remove the Card # from the card component.

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/decks/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed the "Card #" title from flashcard components by eliminating the CardHeader and CardTitle sections entirely

**Summary:**
Cleaned up the flashcard component display by removing the "Card #{card.id}" titles from each card. Since the card numbers weren't providing significant value to users, the entire CardHeader and CardTitle sections were removed. This results in a cleaner card layout that focuses directly on the front and back content without unnecessary header information.

**User Prompt:**
Add confirmation toast to edit, add or delete a card@page.tsx

**Files Modified:**
- `flashcards-app/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Toaster import and component for displaying toast notifications
- `flashcards-app/src/components/AddCardDialog.tsx` - Added toast import and success/error notifications for card creation
- `flashcards-app/src/components/EditCardDialog.tsx` - Added toast import and success/error notifications for card updates
- `flashcards-app/src/components/DeleteCardButton.tsx` - Added toast import and success/error notifications for card deletion
- `flashcards-app/src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` - Installed Sonner toast component (replacement for deprecated toast component)

**Summary:**
Implemented comprehensive toast notifications for all card operations using the Sonner library (shadcn/ui's recommended replacement for the deprecated toast component). Added success toasts for successful operations ("Card added successfully!", "Card updated successfully!", "Card deleted successfully!") and error toasts for failed operations. The Toaster component was added to the root layout to enable toast notifications throughout the application. This provides immediate visual feedback to users for all card management actions, improving the overall user experience.

# Development Logging System

## Automatic Logging Requirements

**MANDATORY**: For every user interaction, you MUST update the current log file with:

1. **User Prompt**: The exact user query/request
2. **Files Changed**: List of all files that were modified/created/deleted
3. **Change Summary**: Brief description of what changes were made
4. **Timestamp**: When the changes occurred

## Log File Management

- **Location**: All logs go in the `logs/` directory
- **Naming**: Use format `development-log-v{VERSION}.md` (e.g., `development-log-v0.1.0.md`)
- **Version Tracking**: When package.json version changes, create a new log file
- **Current Version**: Check [package.json](mdc:package.json) for version info

## Log Entry Format

Each log entry should follow this format:

```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - User Request #{ENTRY_NUMBER}

**User Prompt:**
[Exact user request/query]

**Files Modified:**
- `path/to/file1.ext` - [Brief description of changes]
- `path/to/file2.ext` - [Brief description of changes]

**Summary:**
[Overall summary of what was accomplished]

```

## Implementation Rules

1. **Always check current version** from package.json before logging
2. **Create new log file** if version has changed since last entry
3. **Append to existing log** if version is the same
4. **Never skip logging** - even if no files were changed, log the interaction
5. **Be specific** about changes made to each file

## Current Log File

Based on package.json version 0.1.0, use: `logs/development-log-v0.1.0.md`
